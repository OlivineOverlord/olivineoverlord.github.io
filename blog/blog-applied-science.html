    <article class="section">
      <div class="article-content">
        <p>There’s this term we hear all the time now: <strong>applied science</strong>. It shows up in grant proposals, university mission statements, and government policy documents, usually spoken with pride—“We support applied science.” As if that alone proves the work is useful, relevant, valuable.</p>
        <p>But I’ve been thinking: why do we even need the word <em>applied</em> in front of <em>science</em>?</p>
        <p>What are we saying about the rest of science when we carve this bit out as the legitimate part? What’s being implied, intentionally or not, is that science isn’t really worthwhile unless it's doing something tangible—solving a problem, building a product, feeding a pipeline. That unless it’s <em>applied</em>, it’s indulgent. Academic. Maybe even a waste of time.</p>
        <p>And that’s dangerous thinking.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>“But What’s It For?”</h2>
        <p>It’s not that we don’t want science to have an impact. Of course we do. Science <em>does</em> change lives—sometimes profoundly. But that impact often doesn’t show up right away. And sometimes it takes a direction no one could have predicted at the time of discovery.</p>
        <p>Faraday’s experiments in electromagnetism were once labelled as useless tinkering. They now underpin the entire modern electrical world. Mendel’s pea plants didn’t seem important until decades later, when genetics was born. The plate tectonics revolution changed how we understand everything from earthquakes to ore deposits—but for a long time, it was fringe science, based on ideas that weren’t “applied” to anything.</p>
        <p>If we’d only funded what was already useful, none of those breakthroughs would have happened.</p>
        <p>So when someone says, “What’s this science for?” I get why they’re asking. They want reassurance that their tax dollars or university resources are being spent wisely. But here’s the thing: the answer is often, <em>we don’t know yet</em>. And that’s not a weakness. That’s the strength of science. It’s how we learn new things.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Real Problem Isn’t the Science</h2>
        <p>It’s that most people—through no fault of their own—don’t actually know what science <em>is</em>.</p>
        <p>Not really. We’re taught that it’s a body of facts, or a path to technology, or a means to solve problems. But at its core, science is a way of asking questions. It’s structured curiosity. It’s a disciplined method for exploring things we don’t yet understand—and for holding uncertainty until we can make sense of it.</p>
        <p>And because that process is slow, iterative, and often deeply abstract, it’s hard to explain to someone who’s never done it. That includes a lot of the people who make decisions about science: policy makers, funders, university executives. Often, they don’t fully grasp what they’re evaluating. And rather than say, “We don’t understand this, but we trust the process,” they say, “Prove it. Show us the outcome. Show us the application.”</p>
        <blockquote>In other words, they reshape the science to fit their understanding, instead of expanding their understanding to meet the science.</blockquote>
        <p>That’s not how discovery works.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What Other Field Works Like This?</h2>
        <p>I’ve been turning this over in my head: in what other profession do we ask people to justify their work to people who fundamentally don’t understand it?</p>
        <p>We don’t expect a heart surgeon to rewrite their surgical protocol in plain English for a politician before they’re allowed to operate. We don’t ask a structural engineer to simplify their bridge calculations for a university finance officer. We don’t make a software developer write code in PowerPoint so the board can feel comfortable approving it.</p>
        <p>In most fields, we recognise that expertise involves trust. That professionals are hired because they know things others don’t. That’s the point.</p>
        <p>But in science—especially basic science—that trust is evaporating. Instead, scientists are being told: translate everything. Package your work. Pitch it. Make it legible to people with no training in your field, or lose your funding.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Why This Pressure Is Growing</h2>
        <p>This isn’t just about misunderstanding. It’s also about how our systems are structured.</p>
        <p>Research is now measured by metrics: citations, grant income, spinouts, student satisfaction, policy impact. And all those metrics tilt toward short-term, visible, “applied” outcomes. That’s what gets funded. That’s what gets celebrated. That’s what universities and funding bodies can point to when they need to justify their budgets.</p>
        <p>So naturally, scientists adapt. They reshape their work to meet these expectations. Or they reframe it as something it’s not: suddenly a theoretical physicist is talking about quantum computing, or a field ecologist is pitching climate applications, not because that’s their focus, but because that’s what gets traction.</p>
        <p>And this pressure is especially intense for early-career researchers. If you don’t play the game, you risk being seen as irrelevant. Your work might be rigorous, creative, important—but if it’s not “applied,” it’s at risk of being sidelined.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What Gets Lost</h2>
        <p>What we lose in all this is depth. We lose patience. We lose the messy, slow, beautiful process of discovery.</p>
        <p>When we judge science only by what it produces quickly, we flatten it. We strip it of the uncertainty that makes it powerful. And we replace the pursuit of knowledge with the production of outcomes.</p>
        <p>We also erode trust. Because when science is only ever presented as useful—when it's sold like a product—it starts to feel like a transaction. And people rightly start asking: why isn’t it working yet? Why can’t it fix this problem? Why is it changing its mind?</p>
        <p>But that’s not science failing. That’s the public being misled about what science is meant to do.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>So What Do We Do Instead?</h2>
        <p>We need to make space for <strong>slow science</strong> again.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Funding work that has no immediate application—but deep intellectual value.</li>
          <li>Teaching people that discovery takes time.</li>
          <li>Encouraging institutions to value insight, not just impact.</li>
          <li>Giving scientists the freedom to explore questions without the pressure to turn them into products.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also need <strong>broader scientific literacy</strong>. Not just public engagement, but real investment in helping people understand how science works, why it takes the time it does, and what it means to live in a world where knowledge is always evolving.</p>
        <p>And perhaps most of all, we need a bit more <strong>humility</strong>. Especially from those who hold power over science but don’t practice it.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Let Science Be Science</h2>
        <p><strong>Science doesn’t need to be more applied. We need to be more capable of valuing science as it is.</strong></p>
        <p>When we force research into the frame of usefulness too early, we limit what it can become. We end up asking small questions. Safe questions. Questions with answers we already suspect.</p>
        <p>But the world’s biggest problems won’t be solved by that kind of thinking.</p>
        <p>They’ll be solved by people who were given space to ask deeper questions. People who weren’t told to “prove the point” before they’d even begun.</p>
        <p>Let’s give science room to breathe again. And let’s trust that what grows from that space will matter—even if we don’t recognise its value right away.</p>
