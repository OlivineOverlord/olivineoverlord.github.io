      <div class="article-content">
        <p>There’s this term we hear all the time now: <strong>applied science</strong>. It shows up in grant proposals, university mission statements, and government documents, usually spoken with pride. But the more I hear it, the more I think: why do we even need the word <em>applied</em> in front of <em>science</em>?</p>

        <p>What’s being implied is that science isn’t really valuable unless it produces a product, solves a problem, or serves an external goal. That unless it’s applied, it’s indulgent—maybe even a waste of time. And that’s a problem.</p>

        <h2>We Don’t Know What Science Is</h2>
        <p>Most people don’t actually understand what science <em>is</em>. It’s not just a body of facts or a path to innovation. At its core, science is a method of inquiry—a way of asking questions, testing ideas, and living with uncertainty until we learn something new. The process can be slow, abstract, and messy—and that’s what makes it powerful.</p>

        <h2>Application Isn’t Where Science Begins</h2>
        <p>Some of the most transformative scientific discoveries had no clear “application” when they were made. Faraday’s electromagnetism experiments. Mendel’s genetics. Plate tectonics. The Higgs boson. These discoveries changed the world—but only long after their initial publication. If “usefulness” had been the bar, they may never have been funded.</p>

        <h2>Scientists Aren’t Here to Translate</h2>
        <p>Scientists are increasingly being asked to justify their work in terms of application. To make it legible to funders, politicians, or business interests. But in what other profession is this the norm?</p>
        <p>We don’t ask surgeons to justify procedures to policy officers. We don’t ask civil engineers to make bridge designs legible to financiers. We trust their expertise. So why don’t we offer that same trust to scientists?</p>

        <h2>The System Isn’t Broken—It’s Built This Way</h2>
        <p>This pressure isn’t accidental. It’s systemic. Universities are rewarded for impact metrics, funding bodies demand immediate return, and researchers are subtly trained to pitch instead of explore. This pushes people to reframe their work, not based on what it needs—but on what others want to hear.</p>

        <h2>We Lose Something When We Rush Discovery</h2>
        <p>When we force research to prove its usefulness too soon, we shrink the horizon of what science can be. We lose patience, depth, and risk. We turn the pursuit of knowledge into the production of outcomes. And in doing so, we teach early-career researchers to aim low—because big questions take time.</p>

        <h2>What Science Needs Is Room to Breathe</h2>
        <p>We need to fund deep, long-term inquiry—even when the benefits aren’t immediate. We need institutions that value understanding, not just outputs. And we need more humility from those who evaluate science without practicing it.</p>

        <p><strong>Science doesn’t need to be more applied. We need to be more capable of valuing science as it is.</strong></p>
        <p>Let’s not ask for fruit from a tree we haven’t watered. Let’s trust that the work of discovery matters—even if its value isn’t obvious right away.</p>
